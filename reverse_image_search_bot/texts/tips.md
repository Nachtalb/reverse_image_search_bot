*Tips and Tricks*

- *Full Image*: First of all images should always be uncropped if possible. Most search engines do not support uncropped images as it is much harder to search for matches.

- *Correct Orientation*: Secondly while many search engines do support rotated images, some do not or are worse at finding results with them. So make sure the images have the correct orientation.

- *Videos & GIFs*: When searching for Videos / GIFs we actually search for the first frame in said file. Thus if eg. your video starts with a black screen i you have no chance to find what you want. So it's better sometimes to take a screenshot of said video/GIF at a part when it's easily distinguishable (eg. when a character is visible)

- *Know where to search*: Last but not least. Look at /engines or /more to see what each search engines is good at. I also includes recommendations that should help you find the correct search engine. Eg. you wont find a real life person with SauceNAO as it excels in anime/manga related tasks. But on the other hand you will probably find the source of a Manga page much faster than with any other engine.
